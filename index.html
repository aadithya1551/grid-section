            <article>I received a job offer mid-course and the subjects I learned  were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I  honestly feel I got every penny worth.</article>
            <P>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
               transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
               for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
               The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
               the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            <p> “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
               for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”

            <article>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidence from them and learning from their experience was easy.</article>
            <p> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
               gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
               junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
               an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

            <article>Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended!</article>
            <p> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
               professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
               student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
               did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
               project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
               could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
               experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
               100% recommend! ”</p>
